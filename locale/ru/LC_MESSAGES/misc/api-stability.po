":doc:`The release of Django 1.0 </releases/1.0>` comes with a promise of API "
"stability and forwards-compatibility. In a nutshell, this means that code "
"you develop against a 1.X version of Django will continue to work with "
"future 1.X releases. You may need to make minor changes when upgrading the "
"version of Django your project uses: see the \"Backwards incompatible changes"
"\" section of the :doc:`release note </releases/index>` for the version or "
"versions to which you are upgrading."
