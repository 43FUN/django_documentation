"GeoDjango uses the GDAL geospatial library which is not thread safe at this "
"time.  Thus, it is *highly* recommended to not use threading when deploying "
"-- in other words, use an appropriate configuration of Apache or the prefork "
"method when using FastCGI through another Web server."

"In this section there are some example ``VirtualHost`` directives for when "
"deploying using either ``mod_python`` or ``mod_wsgi``.  At this time, we "
"recommend ``mod_wsgi``, as it is now officially recommended way to deploy "
"Django applications with Apache.  Moreover, if ``mod_python`` is used, then "
"a prefork version of Apache must also be used.  As long as ``mod_wsgi`` is "
"configured correctly, it does not matter whether the version of Apache is "
"prefork or worker."
