"Django is, and will continue to be, a database-agnostic web framework. We "
"would encourage those writing reusable applications for the Django community "
"to write database-agnostic code where practical. However, we recognize that "
"real world projects written using Django need not be database-agnostic. In "
"fact, once a project reaches a given size changing the underlying data store "
"is already a significant challenge and is likely to require changing the "
"code base in some ways to handle differences between the data stores."

"Django provides support for a number of data types which will only work with "
"PostgreSQL. There is no fundamental reason why (for example) a ``contrib."
"mysql`` module does not exist, except that PostgreSQL has the richest "
"feature set of the supported databases so its users have the most to gain."
