"Some parts of Django -- independent of end-user-written applications -- make "
"use of full URLs, including domain name, which are generated from the HTTP "
"Host header. Django's documentation has for some time contained notes "
"advising users on how to configure webservers to ensure that only valid Host "
"headers can reach the Django application. However, it has been reported to "
"us that even with the recommended webserver configurations there are still "
"techniques available for tricking many common webservers into supplying the "
"application with an incorrect and possibly malicious Host header."

"The XML parser in the Python standard library is vulnerable to a number of "
"attacks via external entities and entity expansion. Django uses this parser "
"for deserializing XML-formatted database fixtures. The fixture deserializer "
"is not intended for use with untrusted data, but in order to err on the side "
"of safety in Django 1.3.6 the XML deserializer refuses to parse an XML "
"document with a DTD (DOCTYPE definition), which closes off these attack "
