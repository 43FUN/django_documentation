"While not a new feature, it's important to note that Django 1.2 introduces "

"Python versions from 2.3 up; Django 1.2, however, drops official support for "
"Python 2.3. As such, the minimum Python version required for Django is now "
"2.4, and Django is tested and supported on Python 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6, and will "
"be supported on the as-yet-unreleased Python 2.7."
