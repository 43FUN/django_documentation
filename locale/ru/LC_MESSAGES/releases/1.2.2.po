"In order to test a bug fix that forms part of the 1.2.2 release, it was "
"necessary to add a feature -- the ``enforce_csrf_checks`` flag -- to the :"
"ref:`test client <test-client>`. This flag forces the test client to perform "
"full CSRF checks on forms. The default behavior of the test client hasn't "
"changed, but if you want to do CSRF checks with the test client, it is now "
"possible to do so."
