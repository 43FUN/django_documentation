"Django relies on user input in some cases (e.g. :func:`django.contrib.auth."
"views.login`, :mod:`django.contrib.comments`, and :doc:`i18n </topics/i18n/"
"index>`) to redirect the user to an \"on success\" URL. The security checks "
"for these redirects (namely ``django.util.http.is_safe_url()``) didn't check "
"if the scheme is ``http(s)`` and as such allowed ``javascript:...`` URLs to "
"be entered. If a developer relied on ``is_safe_url()`` to provide safe "
"redirect targets and put such a URL into a link, he could suffer from a XSS "
"attack. This bug doesn't affect Django currently, since we only put this URL "
"into the ``Location`` response header and browsers seem to ignore JavaScript "
"there."
