"Also following up on a previous issue: in July of this year, we made changes "
"to Django's HTTP redirect classes, performing additional validation of the "

"redirect target is a common pattern)."

"problems. So, similar to the Host-header issue, we are taking steps to "
"provide tighter validation in response to reported problems (primarily with "
"third-party applications, but to a certain extent also within Django "
"itself). This comes in two parts:"

"intended for use whenever user-supplied redirect targets are accepted, to "
"ensure that such redirects cannot lead to arbitrary third-party sites."
