"To fix bugs with cookies in Internet Explorer, Safari, and possibly other "
"browsers, our encoding of cookie values was changed so that the characters "
"comma and semi-colon are treated as non-safe characters, and are therefore "
"encoded as ``\\054`` and ``\\073`` respectively.  This could produce "
"backwards incompatibilities, especially if you are storing comma or semi-"
"colon in cookies and have javascript code that parses and manipulates cookie "
"values client-side."

"To make it easier to support both 1.1.X and 1.2.X versions of Django with "

"does nothing - it has no effect on templates or form processing. However, it "
