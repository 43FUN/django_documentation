"Some parts of Django -- independent of end-user-written applications -- make "
"use of full URLs, including domain name, which are generated from the HTTP "
"Host header. Some attacks against this are beyond Django's ability to "
"control, and require the web server to be properly configured; Django's "
"documentation has for some time contained notes advising users on such "
"configuration."

"Django's own built-in parsing of the Host header is, however, still "
"vulnerable, as was reported to us recently. The Host header parsing in "
"Django 1.3.3 and Django 1.4.1 -- specifically, ``django.http.HttpRequest."
"get_host()`` -- was incorrectly handling username/password information in "
"the header. Thus, for example, the following Host header would be accepted "
"by Django when running on \"validsite.com\"::"
