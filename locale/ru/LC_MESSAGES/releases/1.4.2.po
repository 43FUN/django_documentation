"Some parts of Django -- independent of end-user-written applications -- make "

"Django's own built-in parsing of the Host header is, however, still "
"vulnerable, as was reported to us recently. The Host header parsing in "
"Django 1.3.3 and Django 1.4.1 -- specifically, django.http.HttpRequest."
"get_host() -- was incorrectly handling username/password information in the "
"header. Thus, for example, the following Host header would be accepted by "
"Django when running on \"validsite.com\"::"
