"Rendering an attractive and easy-to-use Web form requires more than just "

"This is where Django media definitions come in. Django allows you to "
"associate different media files with the forms and widgets that require that "
"media. For example, if you want to use a calendar to render DateFields, you "
"can define a custom Calendar widget. This widget can then be associated with "
"the CSS and JavaScript that is required to render the calendar. When the "
"Calendar widget is used on a form, Django is able to identify the CSS and "
"JavaScript files that are required, and provide the list of file names in a "
"form suitable for easy inclusion on your Web page."
