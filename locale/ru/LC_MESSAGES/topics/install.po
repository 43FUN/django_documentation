"If you want to use Django on a production site, use `Apache`_ with "
"`mod_wsgi`_. mod_wsgi can operate in one of two modes: an embedded mode and "
"a daemon mode. In embedded mode, mod_wsgi is similar to mod_perl -- it "
"embeds Python within Apache and loads Python code into memory when the "
"server starts. Code stays in memory throughout the life of an Apache "
"process, which leads to significant performance gains over other server "
"arrangements. In daemon mode, mod_wsgi spawns an independent daemon process "
"that handles requests. The daemon process can run as a different user than "
"the Web server, possibly leading to improved security, and the daemon "
"process can be restarted without restarting the entire Apache Web server, "
"possibly making refreshing your codebase more seamless. Consult the mod_wsgi "
"documentation to determine which mode is right for your setup. Make sure you "
"have Apache installed, with the mod_wsgi module activated. Django will work "
"with any version of Apache that supports mod_wsgi."
