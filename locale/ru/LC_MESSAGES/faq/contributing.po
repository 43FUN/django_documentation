"A polite, well-timed message to the mailing list is one way to get "

"the sort of attention you require. However, if you draw attention to a "
"ticket when the core developers are paying particular attention to bugs -- "
"just before a bug fixing sprint, or in the lead up to a beta release for "
"example -- you're much more likely to get a productive response."

"Another reason that bugs might be ignored for while is if the bug is a "
"symptom of a larger problem. While we can spend time writing, testing and "
"applying lots of little patches, sometimes the right solution is to rebuild. "
"If a rebuild or refactor of a particular component has been proposed or is "
"underway, you may find that bugs affecting that component will not get as "
"much attention. Again, this is just a matter of prioritizing scarce "
"resources. By concentrating on the rebuild, we can close all the little bugs "
"at once, and hopefully prevent other little bugs from appearing in the "
"future."

"Whatever the reason, please keep in mind that while you may hit a particular "
"bug regularly, it doesn't necessarily follow that every single Django user "

"evaluate the relative priorities, we are generally trying to consider the "
"needs of the entire community, not just the severity for one particular "
"user. This doesn't mean that we think your problem is unimportant -- just "
"that in the limited time we have available, we will always err on the side "
"of making 10 people happy rather than making 1 person happy."
